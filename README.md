# Weather Chatbot (Dialogflow + Node.js)

##  Overview

This project is a weather chatbot built using Dialogflow ES, a Node.js webhook, and OPenWeather API.
It provides users with:

*  Current weather information
*  8-day weather forecast

The bot integrates with the **OpenWeather API** and returns clean, user-friendly responses.

## ⚙️ Features

### ✅ Current Weather

* Temperature (with feels like)
* Weather condition
* Humidity
* Wind speed
* Visibility

### ✅ Weather Forecast (Up to 8 Days)

* Date-wise forecast
* Temperature (day, min, max, feels like)
* Weather condition
* Humidity
* Wind speed

### ✅ Smart Handling

* Supports user-provided dates
* Validates forecast range (max 8 days)
* Handles invalid city inputs
* Clean formatted responses for chatbot UI

---

## 🧠 Key Implementation Details

### 🔹 Optimized API Usage

* Uses **Current Weather API (2.5)** for real-time weather → lightweight
* Uses **One Call API (3.0)** only for forecast → efficient
* Avoids unnecessary data using:

  ```
  exclude=minutely,hourly,alerts
  ```

---

### 🔹 Dialogflow Response Formatting

Instead of using `\n` for line breaks (which does not render properly in Dialogflow UI),
the bot sends **multiple messages using `fulfillmentMessages`**.

This ensures:

* Proper line-by-line display
* Better readability
* Cleaner user experience

---

### 🔹 Date Handling Logic

* Converts user input date to local format
* Calculates difference from current date
* Maps it to the correct forecast day index

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Axios
* Dialogflow
* OpenWeather API
